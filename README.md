Movie Ticket System

//pseudo code
class object of a movie theater seating
array for the seating




//start the program with a greeting and display the current listings and showtimes
//example
  cout << endl << "****************************************************";
  cout << endl << "~~~~~~~~~~ Welcome to the Chaffey Theatre ~~~~~~~~~~";
  cout << endl << "****************************************************";
  cout << endl << endl << "The current listings and showtimes are: ";

//prompt the user for an upgraded experience or standard seating
  cout << endl << "Would you like to upgrade your tickets for an enhanced experience?";
  cout << endl << "($10 upgrade charge per ticket)";
//cin >> [input variable for preferred seating ];

//prompts the user for the amount of tickets to purchase
  cout << endl << "How many tickets would you like to buy?";
// cin << [variable for tickets to purchase and seats to be occupied in the array];

//displays the current seating arrangement and available seats
  
//Perhaps we could start with a file that has a few occupied seats to show program modularity
//and display what's available for purchase
  
//receive input from the user, requesting an available seat

//run a function to check to see if the seat is available
  //if it is not available, provide feedback to choose another seat

  //if it is available, provide feedback and confirm seat assignment

//prompt for the next ticket and seating arrangement
//run the function again to see if the seat is available and provide feedback

//once the seating arrangements are finalized provide a breakdown of
//the amount of tickets purchased, to which movie and showtime

//save the new seating arrangement to a file

//exit the program and display a greeting to enjoy the movie
