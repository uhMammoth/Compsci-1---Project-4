# May 18, 2019 UPDATE

//Hey guys, at the top of main.cpp I added a header that the Professor typically wants in projects. Check it out and let me know what you think.

//I also included screenshots in our report as proof of us using a repository, only because the assignment sheet mentions that we provide proof that we used one.

//Lastly, I wanted to ask you guys about the peer evaluations rubric. Since we're not presenting or evaluating other groups, do we need to submit anything for that? Thanks guys, Wil.
